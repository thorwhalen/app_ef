# app_ef frontend

A semantic-search corpus UI for `ef`, built on the embeddings group's
TypeScript packages:

- **acture** — the command-dispatch layer. Every user operation is one
  `defineCommand`; the ⌘K command palette, keyboard shortcuts, and the
  Assistant's AI tool calling are all projections of that single registry.
- **zodal** — schema-driven UI. The corpus table's columns and cell
  renderers are inferred from one Zod schema.

It talks to the `app_ef` backend (`qh` over `ef.service.EfService`) — see
[`../backend`](../backend).

## Surfaces

- **Corpora** — create, list, select and delete corpora.
- **Search** — the headline surface: semantic search over the selected corpus.
- **Explore** — a 2-D projected & clustered corpus map.
- **RAG plug-in** — retrieve ranked context segments, plus how to call the
  same endpoint from an external LLM / agent.
- **Assistant** — an AI chat that operates the app through the command
  registry and answers questions grounded in retrieved context.

## Run it

1. Start the backend (from the repo root) — its documented default port is
   `8000`:

   ```bash
   cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. Start the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pnpm install
   pnpm dev          # serves on http://localhost:5173
   ```

3. Open <http://localhost:5173>.

If the backend runs on a non-default port, copy `.env.example` to
`.env.local` and set `VITE_API_BASE`. (In production tw_platform's deploy
injects `VITE_API_BASE=/api/app_ef` — the enlace mount — automatically.)

## Architecture

| Layer | Where | Role |
|---|---|---|
| API client | `src/api/` | typed `fetch` wrapper over the 7 backend endpoints |
| State | `src/state/store.ts` | one zustand store — the app's render state |
| Commands | `src/commands/` | acture `defineCommand`s — every operation, once |
| Assistant | `src/assistant/` | the LLM agent loop — projects the registry as AI tools via `acture-ai-vercel` |
| Schema | `src/schemas/corpus.ts` | the zodal collection for the corpus table |
| UI | `src/surfaces/`, `src/components/` | React 19 + Tailwind + shadcn-style components |
| e2e | `e2e/`, `src/e2e/bridge.ts` | Playwright tests driving the command registry — see [`e2e/README.md`](./e2e/README.md) |

Every user operation is dispatched through the acture registry
(`registry.dispatch(id, params, ctx)`). The surface forms, the ⌘K palette, the
keyboard shortcuts, and the Assistant's AI tool calls are all just *dispatch
surfaces* over that one registry — no scattered `onClick` logic.

The **Assistant** runs the LLM call **directly in the browser** (the Vercel AI
SDK with an OpenAI key the user pastes into the UI and that is kept only in
`localStorage`). `acture-ai-vercel`'s `toAITools` projects the registry as the
model's tools; each tool call routes back through `registry.dispatch`.

## Testing

End-to-end tests live in [`e2e/`](./e2e/README.md), built on
`acture-e2e-playwright` + Playwright. They drive the app through the same
command registry every other surface uses — **an e2e test is a command macro
with assertions**. The page bridge (`src/e2e/bridge.ts`) exposes the registry
on `window` in a DEV build only; the Python backend is mocked, so the suite is
hermetic and deterministic.

```sh
pnpm exec playwright install chromium   # one-time: fetch the browser
pnpm test:e2e                           # run the suite
pnpm typecheck:e2e                      # type-check the e2e sources
```

## zodal and acture come from npm

Both `acture` and `zodal` (`@zodal/core`, `@zodal/store`, `@zodal/ui`,
`@zodal/ui-shadcn`) are installed from npm as version-pinned dependencies, so
`pnpm install` is all the build needs — no sibling checkouts, and CI / the
deploy runner build the frontend without the ecosystem's local layout. A
developer actively editing zodal in place can `pnpm link` it locally without
committing that.

`vite.config.ts` sets `resolve.dedupe` so the app and the zodal packages
share a single copy of React and zod.
